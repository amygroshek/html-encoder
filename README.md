# HTML Encoder

This is a simple script I created to encode HTML markup (for when you need to paste a snipped inside `<code>` tags in JSON, or something). You can access the active page at [this link](https://amygroshek.github.io/html-encoder/index.html). There are, admittedly, [other tools to do this](https://codebeautify.org/html-encode-string). However, mine speeds up the process a bit by automatically wrapping the snippet in `<code>` tags and copying it to the clipboard.
